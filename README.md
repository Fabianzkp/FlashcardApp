#Overview

As a software engineer, I aim to deepen my understanding of Kotlin and modern Android development by building a FlashcardApp. This Android application, developed using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, allows users to create, view, and study flashcards through an intuitive single-screen interface. It demonstrates key Kotlin features, including data classes, mutable and immutable variables, conditionals, and functions, while leveraging Jetpack Compose for UI and SharedPreferences with Gson for data persistence.

The purpose of this software is to provide a practical tool for studying flashcards while showcasing Kotlinâ€™s concise syntax and interoperability with Android libraries. By implementing this app, I explored state management, persistence, and dynamic theming, enhancing my skills in Android development.

#Development Environment
The FlashcardApp was developed using the following tools:
- Android Studio: The primary IDE for Android development, with built-in Kotlin support.
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 17, required for Kotlin compilation.
- Emulator: Pixel 6 with API 33 for testing.
- Physical Device: Android phone for real-world testing.

#The programming language used is Kotlin, with the following libraries:
Jetpack Compose: For building the modern, reactive UI.
SharedPreferences: For local data storage.
Gson: For JSON serialization and deserialization of flashcards.
Material 3: For theming and UI components.

#Future Work:
1.  Add editing and deleting functionality for flashcards.
2.  Implement categories to organize flashcards by topic.
3.  Enhance UI with animations for card flipping and transitions.
4.  Add input validation to prevent empty or duplicate flashcards.
